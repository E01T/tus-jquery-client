# tus-html5-client

The HTML5 client for tus.

## Roadmap

* Build a proof of concept based on the [jQuery File Upload Plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) (in progress)
* Determine if jQuery File Upload should be used in the long run
* Release a reliable, robust and documented HTML5 file uploader

## License

We are still trying to figure out what license to use. MIT or Apache seems most
likely at this point.
